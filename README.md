# Network Automation
As I study for the CCNP ENAUTO exam I have compiled a repo of programs, utilities, scripts, and more that I would like to store for potential future use as a network engineer.


## Setup
Note: this is a setup I have running on an Ubuntu box.

To get going with the files you see here run the following command in your terminal of choice:

` bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/cjmvincent/Network-Automation/install.sh)" `

Setup includes:
* Installing Ansible, and cloning my repo into it's directory
* Installing Check_MK so I can monitor network devices
* Installing tools such Python, Git, Netmiko, Paramiko, Napalm, Net-Tools
